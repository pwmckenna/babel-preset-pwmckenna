# babel-preset-pwmckenna

I use the same babel presets/plugins for all my projects. This makes it super simple for me to configure `.babelrc`. I would recommend __*against*__ anyone else using this. This is kept in sync with [eslint-config-pwmckenna](https://github.com/pwmckenna/eslint-config-pwmckenna) so that eslint enforces the same syntax that babel can compile.

> .babelrc

```js
{
  "presets": ["pwmckenna"]
}
```
